# SHIP FIRST
## Our Development Culture

---

### We Believe

**Working software over perfect architecture**  
**Deployed code over reviewed code**  
**Real feedback over smart assumptions**  
**This week over someday**

---

### Our Commitments

**🚢 We ship every Thursday**  
Something working. In production. Used by clients.

**🔄 We integrate daily**  
If you haven't merged in 2 days, you're building something too big.

**📦 We build in slices, not layers**  
Features go end-to-end. No one owns "just the backend."

**🎯 We start simple**  
The dumbest thing that works beats the elegant thing that's not done.

**🗑️ We delete without ego**  
Sunk cost kills startups. Bad code in production > perfect code in your head.

---

### Our Questions

Before building anything:

1. **Can we fake this manually first?**
2. **What's the smallest version that delivers value?**
3. **Can we ship this by Thursday?**
4. **Who will demo this to the client?**

Before any debate lasting >15 minutes:

5. **What's the simplest thing that works?**
6. **Can we change this later if we're wrong?**

---

### Our Red Flags

🚨 **STOP if any of these are true:**

- More than 3 days since last merge
- Can't demo working software by Thursday  
- Building something that won't be used for >2 weeks
- "Almost done" for more than 3 days
- Having architecture debates for >30 minutes

**Then**: Cut scope, simplify, or ask for help.

---

### Our Rhythm

**Monday**: What's shipping Thursday?  
**Daily**: Are we on track to integrate?  
**Thursday**: Deploy to production  
**Friday**: Demo + "What slowed us down?"

---

### Our One Metric

**Idea → Production → Feedback**

How fast can we complete this loop?  
Everything else is vanity.

---

### Remember

**If you're not slightly embarrassed by v1,  
you shipped too late.**

We're not building a perfect system.  
We're building a company.

**Companies ship.**
