## Daily Standup (Async + Sync)

### Async Update (by 9 AM in Slack)

```
**[Your Name] - [Date]**

Yesterday: [PR links or "still working on X"]
Today: [What you're shipping/merging]
Need: [Pairing time / review / input - or "nothing"]
Blockers: [Specific issue - or "none"]
Status: [On track / behind / need help]
```

**Keep it short** - 5 bullets max, 2 minutes to write.

### Sync Call (9:15 AM, 15 min)

Not for reading updates. For:
1. Coordinate dependencies
2. Solve blockers
3. Adjust scope if needed

**Hard stop at 15 min.** Longer discussions → separate call.

## Red Flags

Raise these in standup:
- 🚨 Same task for 3+ days
- 🚨 Nothing merged for 2+ days  
- 🚨 "Almost done" for 3+ days
- 🚨 Vague blockers
- 🚨 Thursday arrives, can't deploy
