## Our Core Philosophy

**We ship working software every Thursday.**

Why? Because:
- Real feedback beats assumptions
- Deployed code teaches us more than planning
- Fast iteration is our competitive advantage
- Companies ship, perfect systems don't exist

Read the full [Ship First Manifesto](./01-ship-first-manifesto.md) to understand our culture.

## Our Weekly Cadence

| Day | What Happens |
|-----|--------------|
| **Monday** | Plan: What ships Thursday? |
| **Tue-Thu** | Build: Merge daily, pair on integration |
| **Thursday** | Deploy: Ship to production (4 PM) |
| **Friday** | Enable: Turn on features & demo |

See [Weekly Rhythm](./02-weekly-rhythm.md) for full details.

## Key Practices

### 🔄 We Integrate Daily
If you haven't merged in 2 days, your slice is too big.

### 📦 We Build Vertically
Features go end-to-end (UI → API → algorithm → database), not in layers.

### 🎯 We Start Simple
Hardcoded → Simple → Real → Optimized. Each step ships.

### 🗑️ We Delete Without Ego
Bad code in production > perfect code in your head.

### 🚢 We Ship Behind Feature Flags
Deploy code ≠ release features. We control when features go live.
